# TPS-Demo

This is a portfolio project being developed since 23/10/2020

## Objective

The current aim of the project is to archieve a simple Third Person Shooter gameplay experience with:

- A custom controller using Cinemachine for the camera + unity's CharacterController
- A modular weapon system with the use of Bolt for visual scripting and fast iteration
- Use of FSM + Unity's Pathfinding system for a simple Zombie AI

## Resources used

During the development I checked different ways to develop things, here are some links to videos and resources that I consulted so far:

- Brackeys "THIRD PERSON MOVEMENT in Unity" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HpC--2iowE&t=997s
- Unity "Creating a Third Person Camera using Cinemachine in Unity!(Tutorial)" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537B1kJp9YQ
- TheKiwiCoder "Weapon zooming using Cinemachine 3rd person follow camera" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb9FoFEFR3M&t=584s

## Future Objectives

This are interesting things that I'd like to add to the project as time goes on, the current objectives are fullfilled, and my time allows it

- Aim / Feet IK
- Cover System
- Wall-running
